# This repository contains all of the 2024 CREATE Robo in Med Code

## Summary of Projects

View your own pulse using an LED or Arduino IDE's in-built Serial Plotter.

# Artificial Pancreas:
Simulate how the pancreas reacts to changes in blood sugar using an Arduino and a conductivity sensor that you make yourself.
